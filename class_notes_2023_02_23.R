# Linear Models

# y = mx + b
# y = b0 + b1 * x1 + b2 * x2
# residual = y- - y

# Linear regression has 5 key assumptions:

# Linear relationship
# Normality of the model residuals
# No or little multicollinearity
# No auto-correlation (samples are independent)
# Homoscedasticity (homogeneity of variance in residuals across the independent variables)

# a hint is in our R squared values 5% 
# r squared adjusted accounts for complexity 5%

# homoscedasticity good hetero bad
# when the value of y is cmall then the error is higher
# press enter again and we get a Q-Q plot looks pretty good
# press enter again implies that error is less when beaks are bigger
# 4th plot want it to go from wide to narrow

# Residuals vs Fitted Values, to check homogeneity of variance in residuals and linearity of association between predictors and outcome (look for a relatively straight line and random-looking scatterplot). By default, the 3 points with the highest residuals are labeled (i.e. the row number is printed on the figure).
# Normal Q-Q Plot, to check the assumption of normally distributed residuals.
# Root of Standardized residuals vs Fitted values, this is very similar to number 1, where the Y axis of residuals is in a different metric.
# Residuals vs Leverage, to check if the leverage of certain observations are driving abnormal # residual distributions, thus violating assumptions and biasing statistical tests.

# This is an example of Simpsonâ€™s paradox, which occurs when trends that appear when a dataset is separated into groups reverse when the data are aggregated. Basically, when doing statistics, you want to use your brain and your gut to build models that make sense.


# Build a linear model predicting Gentoo bill depth as a function of flipper length. Plot the predictions. Which explanatory variable (bill length vs. flipper length) does a better job of predicting bill depth? What is your evidence?
